This is my code in Python for the Code in Place 2024 final project.

Code in Place is a free introductory programming course using the Python language, based on material from the first half of Stanford University's established intro course, CS106A. It assumes no prior programming experience. CS106A is one of most popular courses at Stanford University, taken by almost 1,600 students every year. It has been developed over the last 30 years by an amazing team, including Nick Parlante, Eric Roberts and more. The course teaches the fundamentals of computer programming using the widely-used Python programming language. Learn more at <a href = "https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/"> Code In Place </href>

For my final project, I created a text-based, solo-play version of the tabletop game <a href = https://oinkgames.com/en/games/analog/deep-sea-adventure/>Deep Sea Adventure </href>. In this game, you are an adventurer searching the depths of the sea for treasure. Going down is easy, but as you gather more treasure, it will be harder and harder to move - treasure is heavy! Will you be able to gather your riches and make it back to the top before your air runs out?
